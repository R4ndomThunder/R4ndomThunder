<h2 align=center>About</h2>
Born in Catania, Italy on December 15 1998.

I grew up between construction bricks and videogames, playing with Sony Playstation 2, Sega Dreamcast, Nintendo DS and Wii, PC and so on.

I started trying to make games in 2014 with RPG Maker VX. I started with a replica of my High School map with quests and so on.

After a couple of years, I've leveled up my programming skills and I started to study Unity & C# as self-tought which is the "combo" that I use today for my projects.

In October 2016, I developed and released [Voxel Rush](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CyberLabStudio.VoxelRush&hl=it&gl=US) my first commercial game on Google Play Store. I release that as [CyberLab Studios](https://cyberlabstudios.dev). This name, throught years become a development group.

As CyberLab Studios our objective is make well-designed and enjoyable videogames.
After a lot of games made for game jams and third parties, in 2020 we began development of [Improbable Soccer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1314500/Improbable_Soccer/), which is our first major commercial project, which was then released on Steam in July of the same year.
